abstract: The integration of Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) system in smart manufacturing environments requires precise constraint specification to effectively utilize manufacturing resources. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating constraint specification from heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited domain knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated adaptation algorithm is introduced to efficiently customize the architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully balances the generative capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing systems, outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint specification tasks.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We propose a practical solution for automating the conversion of raw manufacturing data into job scheduling specifications, addressing a common challenge in implementing APS systems. The proposed architecture can process diverse manufacturing documentation formats, from structured route sheets to natural language instructions, while ensuring reliability through domain-specific representations.
